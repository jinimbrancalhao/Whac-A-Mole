**_Description_**

For this project, I will be making the game Whac-A-Mole. This game will feature a 3x2 grid in which the player will have one minute to click as many of the randomly-generating moles as possible. The game will keep track of how many moles were clicked on and present the amount at the end of the minute.

**_Technologies Used_**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**_Getting Started_**

**_Future Updates_**

- Firstly, I would like to change the design of the website to better convey a fun atmosphere. I believe adding things like animations or other dynamic website elements would help achieve this.
- Secondly, I would like to change the way in which the moles generate. At the moment, the moles randomly generate in a grid, replacing a mole hill. In the future, I would like for the mole to generate in a way that makes it look as if it is coming out of the hill.
